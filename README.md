# Practice
Practice for CTFs will be posted here.

# How to use this repo
1. Post exercises in the "Exercises" folder. Be sure to create a README.md for each exercise. This will help us understand what it is and the objective. This is where you include hints like "The key will have the following format: KEY=...".
2. When you make a change to a file, please update the `Changelog` section.
3. Plesae add your name here (follow format in the code block below), and update this to showcase quick stats. Only modify what is inside the {}
4. If you are unsure of how to make changes to a file, look up a quick youtube tutorial or ask your group mates!
5. Most important: Be safe. Be respectful. Be professional. You will be banned if there are attacks or otherwise malicious intentions.
6. No changes can be made without approval from at least one other person. At this time, it will be for the entire repo; this will hopefully only apply to the Exercises folder.
7. Have fun!
